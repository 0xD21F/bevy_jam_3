## Sorcerian rises

Built in 2 weekends for the [Bevy Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3) using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

The code is a mess, I wouldn't recommend using it as a strong example of good Bevy style. A lot of variable names are nonsensical from rapid refactoring and the systems are like some nightmarish gordian knot. It's fun though.
